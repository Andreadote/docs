## Issue

In the package, you have included binaries that match one of the following extensions:

* exe
* msi
* msu
* msp
* dll
* 7z
* zip
* gz
* tar
* rar
* sfx
* iso
* dmg
* so
* jar

## Recommended Solution

Please remove the binaries or update the package with a [license file](xref:cpmr0005) and a [verification file](xref:cpmr0006).

## Reasoning

If you include binaries in the package, even if you are the software vendor, you need to include confirmation of the right to distribute and verification that the files are legitimate.
